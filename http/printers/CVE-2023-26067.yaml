id: CVE-2023-26067

info:
  name:  Lexmark EWS CMDi
  author: RosePwns
  severity: high
  description: |
    An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the embedded webserver in certain Lexmark devices through 2023-02-19. The vulnerability is only exposed if, when setting up the printer or device, the user selects "Set up Later" when asked if they would like to add an Admin user. If no Admin user is created, the endpoint /cgi-bin/fax_change_faxtrace_settings is accessible without authentication. The endpoint allows the user to configure a number of different fax settings. A number of the configurable parameters on the page fail to be sanitized properly before being used in a bash eval statement, allowing for an unauthenticated user to run arbitrary commands.
  impact: |
    Allows unauthenticated users to run arbitrary commands. 
  remediation: Update firmware
